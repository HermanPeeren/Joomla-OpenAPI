# Joomla-OpenAPI
A complete [OpenAPI](https://learn.openapis.org/) specification of Joomla's web services API. 

Work in progress. For instance:
* Most response objects still have to be added. Have started that with com_media.
* Examples should contain the kind of data that can be expected in Joomla applications.
* Informative and uniform summaries and descriptions should be added to all endpoints (now done until contacts and in media).
* All types should be added correctly.
